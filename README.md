This project implements a series of sorting algorithms, with a focus on efficient sorting for large datasets. It includes a customized three-element sorting method, a partitioning algorithm for quicksort, and a complete quicksort function. The code also includes timing and performance analysis of quicksort to observe how the algorithm scales with the array size.

The primary objectives of this project are:
1. Implement Efficient Sorting: Through a median-of-three partitioning strategy and quicksort, the project ensures sorting efficiency.
2. Partition Verification: The partition function is validated to check that elements are correctly split around the pivot.
3. Performance Analysis: The code uses timing to measure the execution time across varying input sizes, comparing the complexity of quicksort to theoretical expectations.
